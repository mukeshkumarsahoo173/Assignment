    "* Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF) are two concepts in probability theory used to describe the probability distribution of a random variable.\n",
    "#### A Probability Mass Function (PMF) is a function that gives the probability of a discrete random variable taking on each possible value. In other words, it assigns probabilities to each possible outcome of a discrete random variable.\n",
    "* For example, let's say we are rolling a fair six-sided die. The possible outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. The PMF would be a function that assigns a probability to each of these outcomes. Since the die is fair, the probability of rolling any one of these outcomes is 1/6. So the PMF would be:\n",

    "#### The Cumulative Density Function (CDF) is a function that describes the probability that a continuous random variable X takes on a value less than or equal to x. It is denoted by F(x).\n",
    "* In other words, the CDF is the integral of the Probability Density Function (PDF) of X from negative infinity to x. Mathematically, it is defined as:\n",

    "\n",
    "* For example, let's say we have a random variable X that is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. The PDF of X is a constant 1 between 0 and 1, and 0 elsewhere. The CDF of X would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$F(x) = P(X <= x) = ∫(0,x) 1 dt = x, for 0 <= x <= 1$<br> $F(x) = 0, for x < 0$<br> $F(x) = 1, for x > 1$<br>\n",

    "* We can use the CDF to find probabilities for X. For example, the probability that X is between 0.2 and 0.8 is:\n",
    "$P(0.2 < X < 0.8) = F(0.8) - F(0.2) = 0.8 - 0.2 = 0.6$\n",
    "The CDF is useful because it allows us to calculate probabilities for continuous random variables without having to integrate the PDF. Additionally, it provides a convenient way to compare the distributions of different random variables. By comparing the CDFs of two random variables, we can see which one has a greater probability of taking on a certain value, or which one has a greater spread of values."

    "# Q4: Explain the importance of Normal Distribution. Give a few real-life examples of Normal Distribution.\n",
    "ANS\n",
    "* The Normal Distribution is one of the most important probability distributions in statistics. It is used widely in various fields of science, engineering, finance, and social sciences. The importance of Normal Distribution arises from the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sum of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables, regardless of their underlying distribution, tends to follow a Normal Distribution.\n",
    "### The Normal Distribution is important for several reasons:\n",
    "* It provides a framework for modeling and analyzing data with a symmetric bell-shaped distribution.\n",
    "* It is widely used for statistical inference, hypothesis testing, and confidence interval estimation.\n",
    "* Many statistical techniques assume that the underlying data follows a Normal Distribution.\n",
    "* Normal Distribution allows us to use Z-scores to standardize data, which can be helpful in comparing data from different sources.\n",
    "* Here are a few real-life examples of Normal Distribution:\n",
    "Heights and weights of people in a population: These two characteristics typically follow a Normal Distribution. The average height and weight of a population can be described by the Normal Distribution with a certain mean and standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scores on standardized tests: Standardized tests such as the SAT, ACT, or GRE are designed to have a Normal Distribution of scores. The test developers use a large sample of test-takers to create a reference distribution, and then score each test-taker's performance relative to that distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Errors in measurements: When we measure something, we inevitably make some errors due to limitations of the measuring instruments, human error, or other factors. These errors typically follow a Normal Distribution, and understanding their distribution is crucial in determining the precision and accuracy of the measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stock prices: The daily changes in stock prices also follow a Normal Distribution. This is useful for investors who use statistical models to estimate the probability of a certain stock price movement.\n",

The Bernoulli distribution is named after the Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli.\n",

However, it is often useful to model situations where we have a series of binary outcomes, such as the number of heads obtained in multiple coin flips or the number of successes in a sequence of independent trials. This leads us to the binomial distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The main difference between the Bernoulli distribution and the binomial distribution is that the Bernoulli distribution models a single binary outcome, while the binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials. Specifically, the binomial distribution is the probability distribution of the number of successes in n independent Bernoulli trials, each with probability p of success.\n",
    "\n",
    "* An example of the binomial distribution is rolling a die 10 times and counting the number of times it comes up with a 6. Each roll of the die is a Bernoulli trial with probability of success 1/6 (the probability of getting a 6), and the number of 6's obtained in 10 rolls follows a binomial distribution with parameters n=10 and p=1/6.\n",
