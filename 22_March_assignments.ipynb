    "To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the amount of time students spend studying for an exam and their final exam scores, follow these steps:\n",

    "2. Calculate the means: Find the mean (average) of the time spent studying and the mean of the final exam scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Calculate the deviations: For each student, subtract the mean of the time spent studying from their individual study time and do the same for the final exam scores. These differences are called deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Calculate the products: Multiply each pair of deviations. Multiply the deviation for study time with the deviation for exam scores for each student.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Sum the products: Add up all the products calculated in the previous step.\n",
    "\n",

    "The result of this calculation will be the Pearson correlation coefficient. It will range from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, and 0 indicates no linear relationship between the variables.\n",

    "Interpreting the Pearson correlation coefficient depends on its value:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the coefficient is close to -1, it indicates a strong negative linear relationship. This means that as the amount of time spent studying increases, the final exam scores tend to decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the coefficient is close to 1, it indicates a strong positive linear relationship. This means that as the amount of time spent studying increases, the final exam scores tend to increase.\n",

    "* If the coefficient is close to 0, it indicates no significant linear relationship. In this case, the amount of time spent studying has no predictable effect on the final exam scores.\n",
