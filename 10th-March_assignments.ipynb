    "* For example, let's say we are rolling a fair six-sided die. The possible outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. The PMF would be a function that assigns a probability to each of these outcomes. Since the die is fair, the probability of rolling any one of these outcomes is 1/6. So the PMF would be:\n",

By comparing the CDFs of two random variables, we can see which one has a greater probability of taking on a certain value, or which one has a greater spread of values."

    "ANS\n",
    "* The Normal Distribution is one of the most important probability distributions in statistics. It is used widely in various fields of science, engineering, finance, and social sciences. The importance of Normal Distribution arises from the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sum of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables, regardless of their underlying distribution, tends to follow a Normal Distribution.\n",
    "### The Normal Distribution is important for several reasons:\n",
    "* It provides a framework for modeling and analyzing data with a symmetric bell-shaped distribution.\n",
    "* It is widely used for statistical inference, hypothesis testing, and confidence interval estimation.\n",
    "* Many statistical techniques assume that the underlying data follows a Normal Distribution.\n",
    "* Normal Distribution allows us to use Z-scores to standardize data, which can be helpful in comparing data from different sources.\n",
    "* Here are a few real-life examples of Normal Distribution:\n",
    "Heights and weights of people in a population: These two characteristics typically follow a Normal Distribution. The average height and weight of a population can be described by the Normal Distribution with a certain mean and standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scores on standardized tests: Standardized tests such as the SAT, ACT, or GRE are designed to have a Normal Distribution of scores. The test developers use a large sample of test-takers to create a reference distribution, and then score each test-taker's performance relative to that distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Errors in measurements: When we measure something, we inevitably make some errors due to limitations of the measuring instruments, human error, or other factors. These errors typically follow a Normal Distribution, and understanding their distribution is crucial in determining the precision and accuracy of the measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stock prices: The daily changes in stock prices also follow a Normal Distribution. This is useful for investors who use statistical models to estimate the probability of a certain stock price movement.\n",

The Bernoulli distribution is named after the Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli.\n",

    "# Q6: What is a null and alternative hypothesis? Give some examples.\n",
    "ANS\n",
    "In statistics, a null hypothesis is a statement that suggests there is no significant difference or relationship between two variables, while an alternative hypothesis is a statement that suggests otherwise. The null hypothesis is usually denoted as H0, while the alternative hypothesis is denoted as Ha.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of null and alternative hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "Null Hypothesis: The average height of men and women is the same. Alternative Hypothesis: The average height of men and women is different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Null Hypothesis: A new drug does not have any effect on patients' blood pressure. Alternative Hypothesis: A new drug has an effect on patients' blood pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Null Hypothesis: There is no relationship between age and income. Alternative Hypothesis: There is a relationship between age and income.\n",
    "\n",
    "Null Hypothesis: The mean scores of two groups on a test are equal. Alternative Hypothesis: The mean scores of two groups on a test are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Null Hypothesis: A new advertising campaign has no effect on sales. Alternative Hypothesis: A new advertising campaign has an effect on sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis is usually tested using statistical tests, such as t-tests, ANOVA, and regression analysis. The decision to reject or accept the null hypothesis is based on the level of significance or p-value obtained from the statistical test."

    "# Q7: Write down the steps involved in hypothesis testing\n",
    "ANS\n",
    "* Hypothesis testing is a process used in statistics to determine the validity of a hypothesis or claim. The following are the steps involved in hypothesis testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "* State the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis: The first step in hypothesis testing is to clearly state the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis. The null hypothesis is the statement that we want to test, while the alternative hypothesis is the statement that we accept if we reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Set the significance level: The significance level (also known as alpha) is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. It is typically set at 0.05 or 0.01.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Determine the appropriate test statistic: The appropriate test statistic depends on the type of data being analyzed and the research question being asked.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calculate the test statistic: Once the appropriate test statistic has been determined, calculate the test statistic using the data collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Determine the p-value: The p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme or more extreme than the observed test statistic under the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make a decision: If the p-value is less than the significance level, reject the null hypothesis. If the p-value is greater than the significance level, fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Interpret the results: If the null hypothesis is rejected, interpret the results in light of the research question and alternative hypothesis. If the null hypothesis is not rejected, interpret the results in light of the limitations of the study and the research question.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Draw conclusions: Based on the results of the hypothesis test, draw conclusions about the research question and hypothesis being tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is important to note that hypothesis testing is just one tool used in statistical analysis, and that conclusions should be drawn based on a full understanding of the limitations and assumptions of the statistical methods used."

    "# Q8. Define p-value and explain its significance in hypothesis testing\n",
    "ANS\n",
    "* The p-value is a statistical measure used to determine the level of significance of an observed result in hypothesis testing. It represents the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme or more extreme than the observed test statistic, assuming that the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In other words, the p-value represents the likelihood of observing the result, or a more extreme result, under the assumption that there is no true effect or difference between the two groups being compared. If the p-value is small, it suggests that the observed result is unlikely to occur by chance alone, and therefore provides evidence against the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In hypothesis testing, the p-value is used to make a decision about whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis. If the p-value is smaller than the pre-determined significance level (usually set at 0.05 or 0.01), the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis, indicating that the observed result is statistically significant. On the other hand, if the p-value is greater than the significance level, the null hypothesis is not rejected, indicating that the observed result is not statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The p-value is important in hypothesis testing because it provides a way to assess the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. A smaller p-value indicates stronger evidence against the null hypothesis and suggests that the observed result is less likely to be due to chance. It is important to note that the p-value does not provide direct evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis, but rather provides evidence against the null hypothesis."

    "The Student's t-distribution is a probability distribution that is used in statistical inference for hypothesis testing and constructing confidence intervals when the sample size is small or when the population standard deviation is unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "The t-distribution is similar in shape to the standard normal distribution (bell-shaped and symmetric), but it has heavier tails. The shape of the t-distribution depends on the degrees of freedom, which is determined by the sample size. As the sample size increases, the t-distribution approaches the standard normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The t-distribution is used in situations where the population standard deviation is unknown and needs to be estimated from the sample. When the sample size is small (typically less than 30), using the t-distribution is more appropriate than assuming a normal distribution. This is because with a small sample size, there is more uncertainty in estimating the population parameters, and the t-distribution accounts for this additional uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common use cases for the t-distribution include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Confidence intervals: When estimating a population parameter (such as the mean) based on a sample, the t-distribution is used to construct confidence intervals. These intervals provide a range of values within which the population parameter is likely to fall.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hypothesis testing: The t-distribution is used to test hypotheses about population parameters. For example, it can be used to compare means between two groups or test whether a sample mean differs significantly from a hypothesized value.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Small sample sizes: When dealing with small sample sizes, the t-distribution is preferred over the standard normal distribution because it provides more accurate inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the t-distribution is a valuable tool in statistical analysis when the sample size is small and the population standard deviation is unknown. It allows for more accurate inference by accounting for the additional uncertainty introduced by these factors.\n"

    "\n",
    "* The t-distribution has a bell-shaped curve, like the normal distribution, but with heavier tails. This means that it has more probability in the tails than the normal distribution. The shape of the t-distribution depends on a parameter called degrees of freedom (df), which is determined by the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The t-distribution is used in hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation when the population variance is unknown and the sample size is small. Specifically, when the sample size is less than 30 or the population variance is unknown, the t-distribution is used instead of the normal distribution to calculate the probability of obtaining a given sample mean. In these situations, the t-distribution provides a better approximation of the true sampling distribution of the mean.\n",
